When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- If you are working with other people or are working away from your local computer you can have all of the files for the documents in the same place. when you go back to your local computer you can push the changes down to it. You can also see the changes that other people have made to your code


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are internal to github. This is when you make a copy of someone elses repository the copy is made as a fork withink Github. You can fork anyones repository and use it if it is public. You would use this if you want to learn the code that someone else has used to do similar work. Or if you want to add to the work that someone else has done to make improvements and ting. You will not be able to re-contribute to the repository that you forked from via merging.

Clones are external to github 

Branches are external as well and when you want to work on a repository that you are a team member of. This means that you can then merge the repositories together after any augmentation has been completed. These arent really clones but are more taking the code and going in a different direction to what you would have done before.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- It is good to have a copy of the last known state so that you can work on code seperately. and when you don't have acces to the internet. You can be safe in the knowledge that you can merge the local and the remote code at a later date. You will not miss out! 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- If you were collaborating without Git or GitHub you would have to send messages to each other each time you were to make a change. This would be harder in that you onely one person could work on the file at a time or that there would be greater risk of making conflicting errors. It is easier in the way that you dont have to use github!
